“Tokensur”  and hereinafter referred to as “Tokensur“), provides certain Users, such as 
investors and any other party (such as issuers or agents) involved in a Digital Asset Offering 
(as defined below), with a digital identity based on a Distributed Ledger Network (as defined 
below), which can be made available to pre-approved parties (hereinafter referred to as 
“TOKENSUR dApp“). Through TOKENSUR DAPP, provided by Tokensur, users can 
establish a digital identity demonstrating their ability to hold, issue, and manage Digital 
Assets on a distributed ledger. They can also have one or more wallets linked to their digital 
identity, enabling them to store Digital Assets or tokens and sign transactions. Additionally, 
personal data associated with their digital identity can be securely stored outside the 
distributed ledger, enabling them to manage, maintain, and use it for any identification, 
qualification, or signature process related to acquiring, holding, or managing Digital Assets, 
tokens, or any other procedure that utilizes TOKENSUR DAPP. By agreeing to these Terms

							<p class="text-politica" id="texto2">In these Terms of Service, any capitalized term used in singular or plural will have the meaning defined here. The Agreement refers to these Terms and Conditions. A Claim refers to the different types of data found in a TOKENSUR DAPP. Data pertains to the user's 
information saved in their TOKENSUR DAPP, which may include Personal Data. Digital 
Assets stand for a digital version of value that is traded, issued, and transferred through a

operating system that uses blockchain technology and smart contract functionality. GDPR is 
a regulation that protects natural persons' personal data and ensures its free movement.

is a programmable code that creates the User's TOKENSUR DAPP based on the 
Distributed Ledger Network protocol. Users refer to individuals, companies, or organizations 
that use or intend to use Tokensur's services, including having an TOKENSUR DAPP 
and/or benefiting from the TOKENSUR DAPP service.

    <h6 class="subtitle-politica" id="subtitulo21">12. TERMINATION</h6>
    <p class="text-politica" id="texto17">Each Party may terminate the Agreement at any time. 
Since the TOKENSUR DAPP may depend on the infrastructure which Tokensur uses, the 
User acknowledges that Tokensur may terminate the Agreement without compensation if 
the host terminates its hosting service for whatever reason, or if any other party terminates 
its services for whatever reason. 
In addition, in the event of a breach by either party to any of the obligations under the terms 
of the Agreement, that has not been remedied within thirty (30) calendar days after notice 
has been given to the breaching party,  the other party shall be entitled to terminate the 
Agreement, without  prejudice to any damages which it may claim. Any claim brought by the 
User for compensation related to any breach of the Agreement cannot exceed the total 
value of the fees collected by Tokensur from such User. 
Exceptionally, Tokensur reserves the right to automatically terminate the Agreement without 
notice or compensation in the event that the User or any third parties prejudice in any way 
the integrity of the TOKENSUR DAPP, intellectual property rights, reputation or image of 
Tokensur’s brand products. 
Upon termination of the Agreement for breach by the User, all sums paid shall be retained 
by Tokensur, which will charge all fees remaining due until the end of the Agreement, and 
such fees shall become immediately due and payable on the effective date of termination. 
Upon any termination of the Agreement for breach by Tokensur, Tokensur issues a credit 
note for any unpaid invoice issued for the remainder of the period until the date of actual 
termination,  and keeps the fees collected and/or past due for the period up until the 
effective termination.</p>

send to the User a copy of any Data requested by the User in Tokensur’s standard format, 
at the User’s request.</p>

    <h6 class="subtitle-politica" id="subtitulo23">14. MISCELLANEOUS</h6>
    <p class="text-politica" id="texto19">These Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement between the User and 
Tokensur in respect of the TOKENSUR DAPP. The User shall not be entitled to assign its 
TOKENSUR DAPP or related services to any third party without the express written consent 
of Tokensur. 
In the event that one or more stipulations of these would be considered  invalid, inapplicable 
or unenforceable by any court of competent  jurisdiction, the remaining provisions hereof 
shall remain valid unless  otherwise specified by that court. The User and Tokensur agree 
that, in such case, they will negotiate in good faith the terms of replacement will be valid, 
enforceable and binding. 
In cases of force majeure, the obligations of the parties shall be suspended for the duration 
thereof. If the force majeure event continues for more than three (3) months, this Agreement 
may be terminated by written notice sent by either party to the other party, unless otherwise 
agreed between the parties. 
The failure of either party not to claim a commitment by the other party to any of the 
obligations contemplated herein cannot be interpreted as a waiver thereof. 
In case of dispute, evidence provided by Tokensur of the actions of the User or any third 
party, using the connection logs and transmissions identified by Tokensur, shall be 
considered as the only true and authentic evidence, particularly with regard to the date, 
nature and content of any Data and reports. 
As a result of the particular technologies that it uses as part of the TOKENSUR DAPP 
related services, Tokensur reserves the right to modify at any time without notice at its sole 
discretion the content of these Terms and Conditions, which take effect from the date of 
notification to the User. In case of substantial changes to the TOKENSUR DAPP related 
services, the User will be able to request the termination of the Agreement with one (1) 
month’s prior written notice. Tokensur shall not have to pay any compensation to the User 
due to the modification of the Terms and Conditions or termination of the Agreement as a 
consequence thereof.</p>
